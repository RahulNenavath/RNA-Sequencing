# RNA-Sequencing:
1. Read the PAAD Gene-expression dataset using cmapPY package. Analyzed & vistualized the gene expression data across many samples 
for better better understanding of the data.
2. Performed Dimentionality Reduction to visualize the higher dimensional data in a lower dimensions ( 2D and 3D ) and tried to understand
whether the Cancerous tumors are saprable from the Non-Cancerous ones.
3. Performed basic Gene Set Enrichment Analysis using gseapy package.

Tried to apply GSVA algorithm on gene-expression data using R (docker) and Python but could'nt do it due to an internal error 
of "Not availability of pathways.csv".

Challenges Faced:
* Understanding and dealing gene-expression datasets which are non-typical in nature.
* dealing with missing values in such higher dimensional dataset.
* Analysis of biological data and realizing how genes correlate. 
* Finding appropriate geneset.gmt file to give as an input to GSVA algorithm.
